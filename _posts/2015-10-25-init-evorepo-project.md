### So it begins..

So our small quest begins. We hope it's going to be a cool and fun ride. That is the actual purpose, is it not?
What do we want to build? Well it has been a pretty gruesome fight through various ideas, but one stood out as a definite winner. Although other options are still pretty eye catching. But we'll stick to the plan.

Our little toy project is called **_Evorepo_**. The name is .. not really self explanatory. It has two main pieces that form a whole. And of course, we will be detailing them further.
	
The first is the Repo part, or, more explicit, the repository part. The project focuses on data provided by Github about the projects it is hosting and their contributors to be able to draw particular conclusions about various aspects. 

As an example, the data provided about a particular pull request on a project could be linked to future pull requests on the same files and lines of code. If a future update on the project fixes a security bug modifying lines of code written by a particular contributor on a former request, you could draw the conclusion that the programmer in question has "built" that security bug.

Also, by linking the data available about all the contributions of a programmer on a series of projects, you could draw a few conclusions about his skill level, favorite programming language, working patterns and other little pieces of information.

The second part refers to Evolution (don't mind the name, its sounds better with "Evo" first). This part touches on the data uncovered by the Repo data collection. Once we have a few ideas put toghether about a certain project, analysing the same characteristics over a longer period of time could ofer new information. 

For example, we could find out how a project evolved over time and what contributions led to eventually more downloads and a bigger adoption. That is just one cat in the bag. Many more to come :D.

The project aims to provide an interface through which we can visually analize Github data (there is a lot of data there), and eventually, while putting it all toghether, draw some useful conclussions.

More updates to come soon about our progress. Also, we will soon cover a more detailed look (technical, of course) on how we would like to acomplish our goal.Wish us luck. Hopefully, we're not going to need it and all will be nice and dandy.
